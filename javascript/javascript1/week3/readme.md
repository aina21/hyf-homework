# Homework

## Why should i even do this homework?
Array's has lots of helper functions, that is used all the time when developing js applications. It is super helpful to be able to **manipulate an array** like **removing elements** or **adding elements** at specific indexes. Another helpful function of arrays is to know **where a specific item is** in the array.

Objects can be used for **representing data** and it can **help structure your code**. An object can fx represent a user that has a firstname, surname, profile picture and a list of friends. It is constantly used in javascript and **essential to learning the language**.

## Javascript warmup

Its warmup time!

### Item array removal

Remove the item in `names` that is equal to `nameToRemove`

Copy the code below to your homework

```js

const names = ['Peter', 'Ahmad', 'Yana', 'kristina', 'Rasmus', 'Samuel', 'katrine', 'Tala'];
const nameToRemove = 'Ahmad';

// Write some code here

// Code done

console.log(names); // ['Peter', 'Yana', 'kristina', 'Rasmus', 'Samuel', 'katrine', 'Tala']
```

### When will we be there??
Write a function where you speficy your speed in `km/h` and how far you have to go in `km`. The function has to return the time it will take to arrive at your destination. The time should be formatted like this: `3 hours and 34 minutes`.

*Hint:* For formatting your best friend is Google!

```js
const travelInformation = {
  speed: 50,
  destinationDistance: 432,
};

const travelTime = notThisFunctionName(travelInformation);
console.log(travelTime); // 4 hours and 42 minutes
```

### Series duration of my life

```js
const seriesDurations = [
  {
    title: 'Game of thrones',
    days: 3,
    hours: 1,
    minutes: 0,  
  },
  {
    title: 'Sopranos',
    days: 3,
    hours: 14,
    minutes: 0,
  },
  {
    title: 'The Wire',
    days: 2,
    hours: 12,
    minutes: 0,
  }
]
```

How much time of my life have i been watching series? Lets find out! Calculate **how much time a series** have taken as a **percentage of an average lifespan** of 80 years.

Firstly change the `seriesDurations` object to include your favorite series. Find the duration of a series here: http://tiii.me/

Using the `seriesDurations` log out the text:

```
Game of thrones took 0.01% of my life
Sopranos took 0.012% of my life
The Wire took 0.007% of my life

In total that is 0.2% of my life
```

### My favorite songs

Lets create some js where you can add songs from a list of available songs to your own list of songs you like.

```js
const songDatabase = [{
    songId: 1,
    title: 'My baby',
    artist: 'Soggy socks',
  },
  {
    songId: 2,
    title: '3 nails in wood',
    artist: 'The carpenters',
  },
  {
    songId: 3,
    title: 'Blacker than black',
    artist: 'Instant coffee',
  },
  {
    songId: 4,
    title: 'When is enough too little?',
    artist: 'The spies girls',
  },
];

const myPlaylist = [];
```

> In this task when i mention a song i mean an `object` that is represented as a song. You can also say that a song is represented **as an** object

#### Add song to database
Lets create a function that can **add a song** to the `songDatabase` array.

The function should be called `addSongToDatabase` and have one parameter called `song`. The type of `song` should be an object with the same keys as the songs in the `songDatabase` array.

Now **add some of your favorite songs to the database** using `addSongToDatabase`.

Now a question for you! Should this function return anything? What do you think, why/why not?

#### Searching for a song
Create a function called `getSongByTitle` that returns the songs that match a song title. It has one parameter called `title`. It should return 
the song that match the `title` parameter. 

Lets give an example:

```js
const searchedSong = getSongByTitle('When is enough too little?');
console.log(searchedSong); // returns { songId: 4, title: 'When is enough too little', artist: 'The spies girls'}

const searchedSong2 = getSongByTitle('When is enough too');
console.log(searchedSong); // returns undefined
```

Try to use the function by searching for some different songs that are in the `songDatabase` and some that are not.

*Hint:* First find the index of the object in the `songDatabase` array where the title match, then return that index of the `songDatabase` array.

*Optional:* Add fuzzy search, so we can search for "When enough to little?" and still get the song with id 4.

#### Create our own playlist
Lets use the two functions we have created to **make our own playlist!**
Create a new function called `addSongToMyPlaylist` it has a parameter called `title`. 

Using the `getSongByTitle` and the `addSong` functions create a function where you specify the song title of the song you would like in your playlist!

Here is an example:

```js
addSongToMyPlaylist('3 nails in wood');
console.log(myPlaylist); // [{ songId: 2, title: '3 nails in wood', artist: 'The carpenters' }]
```

Use this function to add some songs to your playlist!

#### Improving our application *optional*
What if there are multiple songs with the same name? Then we have problems in our `getSongByTitle` function! Instead of returning a song, return an array of songs that match the title parameter.

What if a user had multiple playlists? How could we accomodate that? Either describe how to fix this problem or make some code!

## Step 3: Smart-ease - Back to the basics!
Smart-ease is going back to the basics. As always Smart-ease starts by helping people fix their problems. So lets venture out into the real world and see what we find:

### NOnoN0nOYes (Note taking app)
> You are sitting at a meeting. A person is presenting some interesting thought that you want to write down. You check your bag, but realise that you forgot to bring your notepad. Hmm you check the internet for an online solution. But you need to signup for them all, too bad... Maybe this could be a worthwhile problem so solve. Lets create a simple and easy to use notepad 📝

#### Save a note
The first thing we will create is the functionality to **save a note**:
Create a variable called `notes` and assign it to an empty array.
Create a function called `addNote`. The `addNote` has two parameters: 
- `content` parameter is a string. 
- `id` is a number.

The `addNote` function shall push an object to the notes array. This object has two keys: `content` and `id`, that corresponds to the function parameters. The value of the keys should be the value of the corresponding parameters. 

#### Get a note
**Now a user can add a note**, but what if a user wants to **see a specific note**, but only remembers the id? Lets create that functionality for him:
Create a function called `getNoteFromId`. The function has one parameter called `id`. When calling this function with an id it should return the relevant note object that corresponds to the id. If no id is specified or if the id is not a number, log out an error string. 
Hint: Use a for loop.

#### Get all notes
Should return an array of the notes.

#### Log out notes
Now a user can both add and get a note. What if the user just wants to **read all his notes?** Lets also create that functionality:
Create a function `logOutNotesFormatted`. When calling the function it should log this string out for every note:
"The note with id: 1, has the following note text: "some example note"."

#### Unique feature
Suddenly you get this great idea for making the note app even better! 

Come up with a unique feature **you think would make this app better.** Write down the idea and see if you can implement it. If not dont worry :) If it is too hard to implement try and ask in the slack channel :)

Try an **interactive version 💻 of your code** [here](https://codepen.io/hackyourfuture-cph/pen/GeMzdE). Remember to insert your code in the top of the codepen :)

### CactusIO-interactive (Smart phone usage app) *optional*
> After a long day you come home to relax. The first thing you do is find your phone and start watching some youtube. Then check facebook, and then reading some news. Suddently a hour has passed. What happened to all that time you think to yourself. Maybe we can create some program to help with this problem! What if we could help users manage their smart phone usage?

Its going to work like this: A user can add smartphone activities. Then he can see a status on how his smartphone usage is going. 

#### Adding an activity
Lets create the first part of the functionality that is **adding activities.**

Create a variable called `activities` that stores all activities of the day. What type of variable would you think would make sense?
Create a function called `addActivity`. It should have three parameters: `date`, `activity` and `duration`. The `date` should be a string, the `activity` a string and the `duration` a number. To save the activity push an object that contains the date, the activity and the duration to the activities variable. 

Now a user can add an activity by writing:

```js
addActivity('23/7-18', 'Youtube', 30);

/*
activities should now look like this
[{
    date: '23/7-18',
    activity: 'Youtube',
    duration: 30,
}]
*/
```

Just adding activities wont help the user very much, we need to **add some functionality** to show the user how **his smart phone usage is going.**

#### Show my status
Create a function called `showStatus`. This function should use the activities variable and return a string saying the following:
"You have added 3 activities. They amount to 78 min. of usage"
```js
showStatus(activities); // will log out this "You have added 3 activities. They amount to 78 min. of usage"
```
Now what happens if we call `showStatus` and `activities` is empty? We need to take that into consideration: If `activities` is empty log out a string that says: "Add some activities before calling showStatus"

#### Usage limit
A user asks us if it is possible to **set a limit for his smartphone usage.** "Off course it is" we promptly reply! 
We need to store that limit somewhere, but where and what type should this be?
So how should it work? When `showStatus` is called and the users usage is above the limit he set. Log out the following string: "You have reached your limit, no more smartphoning for you!"

Try and add some activities and call `showStatus`

#### Extra feature
Come up with one feature you think would be helpful for this program.

Optional
* Lets improve the `addActivity`, so that we dont need to specify the date, but the function automatically figures out what the date is. Check out this link: https://stackoverflow.com/a/34015511
* Improve the `showStatus` function by only showing the number of actitivies for that specific day.
* Create a function for calculating the activity a user has spent the most time on.
